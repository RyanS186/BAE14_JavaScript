What did you learn today?
I've only looked at some basics of JavaScript in the past, so a lot of today was new to me.
Functions were probably the only area I had 0 experience with.

What are you strong with and what are you weak with?
Throughout the tasks today, I made use of a lot of loops and if statements, so I'd say I'm pretty strong with those.
In terms of weaknesses, I think I could use more practice with switch statements, and  learning more about the methods we have available to use in JavaScript.

How can you improve?
I'm going to read back through QA Community and take down some notes. I'll also be looking in to the FreeCodeCamp courses you recommended today.

How confident are you out of 10?
7/10
