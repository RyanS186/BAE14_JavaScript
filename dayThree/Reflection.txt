What did you learn today?
Most of today was new to me, I've interacted with APIs before, but not quite to the extend we went through today.
Promises were also a new concept.

What are you strong with and what are you weak with?

Styling the calculator was probably the strong point of the day, I guess I like CSS haha

Weaknesses, axios and APIs

How can you improve?
I'm going to work through the Axios Crash Course over the weekend

How confident are you out of 10?
6/10
