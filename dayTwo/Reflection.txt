What did you learn today?
Everything from today was new to me:
- Objects, arrays & JSONs
- Methods
- Arrow functions
- Conditionals
- DOM manipulation

What are you strong with and what are you weak with?
I'm confident with most of todays content, but need to look at some of the methods and DOM manipulation in more detail.

How can you improve?
I'll be reviewing the DOM manipulation page on QA community, and trying to put it in to practice

How confident are you out of 10?
